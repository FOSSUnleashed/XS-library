This is a collection of library functions written for the `XS` shell
\<https://github.com/TieDyedDevil/XS.git>.

Note that `XS` must load these library files via its standard initialization
file: `~/.xsrc`. A sample `~/.xsrc` file is included (as `_xsrc`) for
illustration.

IMPORTANT: This is *not* intended to be an "XS standard library, but rather
an illustration of useful techniques. That said, *I* use this library on a
daily basis.
